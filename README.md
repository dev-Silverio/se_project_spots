**Intro**
  
Project Spots is all about creating an exceptonally optimized and highly responsive web design that adapts to many common screen sizes ranging from as small as, 320px, to upwards of 1440px.  
  
**Tech**  

Spots makes full use of html and css employing many of their tools to ensure its optimization and responsiveness. One example of such a tool is the use of media queries allowing the web page
to reorient its content to fit for varying screen sizes.
